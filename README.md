# machine-translation
School project exploring seq-2-seq models for machine translation.

### Usage
Development was done on Google Colab environment. 
* `main.ipynb` - file containing main logic of training, selecting and evaluating models.
* `preprocessing.py` - script with util functions for data preprocessing.
* `models.py` - script with util functions for creating different models.
* `wikipedia.ipynb` - notebook that downloads and translates wikipedia article, saved to csv file.

Folder `Data` contains datasets. There are no GloVe ambeddings there, but they can be downloaded from https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/.

Folder `Results` contains some training metrics and translations generated by the models.

There is no folder `Models` that should containe saved models. It is available there: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OfbNaHTfRLlajUzOFnUElVZp4Q6lQ4Sn?usp=sharing
